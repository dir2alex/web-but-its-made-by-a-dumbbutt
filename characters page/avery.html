                RULER OF ELVES
                    The name Avery is an English and French name meaning "ruler of elves."<br>
                    It's derived from the Anglo-Saxon name Alfred and the Ancient Germanic name Alberich.
            </div>
            <div class="text-avery">
                <p>Avery had a rough childhood, and likely suffers a lifelong disease throughout the rest
                    of her life. She was born from a stripper and a unwealthy man. Technically, she wasnt a
                    planned baby. They wanted to perform an abortion for her, but due to the cost of abortion 
                    operation, the mother had no choice but to give birth to her. The two mother and father 
                    tried their best to make it impossible for the baby to be born, but it didnt go their way.
                    Avery was born as a healthy child, however the mother died after giving labor. Of course, 
                    the father didnt want to raise her, but the hospital doesnt hold responsibility for raising
                    a child. So, the father ends up taking her in after all. Avery continued to live in the forest
                    where there are less humans and more creatures laying about. The father was not very kind 
                    or nurturing to Avery throughout her life... he was a pitiful man who just uses his daughter
                    as he pleases. This made Avery into a crybaby child, longing for a loving mother who isnt 
                    there anymore. Tormented from her father, Avery tried to run away from home plenty of times, 
                    but she keeps failing, as her father would try to chase him down. They live in the forest solely
                    because they are an illegal citizen. One night, after she sneaked out of the house, she felt
                    bad and goes back home when its evening, however... she was then greeted with father's "friends"
                    who looks scary. She is scared because they look at her like she is a piece of meat. Then she was
                    brutally used by fathers "friends" like an item, this had caused her a great trauma and a big scar
                    for her life. She tried to clean all the sins away, but she feels dirty.. so dirty.... no matter
                    how many times she cleans herself, she feels like she is disgusting. She just wants this misery to 
                    end already... As she grows older, she gets better at planning how to sneak
                    out of the house. One day, she was able to get out of that house. But, there were traps set 
                    around the house that makes her unable to go farther than the limit. This had caused her to 
                    step into a giant bear trap, where it captures her leg, however, she keeps on pursuing the
                    outer world so that she can finally be free. Her father keeps chasing her until she found herself
                    hiding somewhere beneath the trees. He gave up, so Avery was saved for a while. She thought She
                    would die from blood loss, however, when she wake up her leg appears to be just fine. That is 
                    because there is a secret caretaker that has been watching her for a long while (refer to another
                    character). Avery got to see what the city are like, however she was disappointed to learn that
                    everyone is just as equally as cruel as her dad is. Everyone disrespects females, and they are
                    corruptions left and right. She isnt safe anywhere. This created some sort of view of hatred 
                    towards humanity. All that aside, Avery felt more free than staying at home with his dad. 
                    However, the joy was shortlived as his dad found him lurking around the small town and she was
                    sent back home. At home, she was verbally abused with how dangerous it is to go outside and 
                    being an illegal citizen makes them a target of a cop. Avery doesnt understand any of that....
                    all she wanted was to be free and rid of from this house. The days got worse and worse, her 
                    dad gets angrier and angrier from time to time. She isnt safe, she will die a horrible death
                    if she keeps existing. For a child to have that kind of mentality, something broke inside of her.
                    One lonely night, she was crying to herself how painful it is to live, then incomes a spirit, a voice.
                    It spoke to Avery, trying to tell her she wont accomplish anything just by crying.

            <div class="text-avery2">
                <h1>Power</h1>
                <p>"You have seen what humanity is like in its purest form. A disgusting pile of flesh
                    walking in this world to pollute and corrupt everything they sought after."
                    "Child, I know what you wish for this world. And im here to grant you that."
                    "Come to the forest, and I shall grant thou a great power to erase humanity."
                    "Humanity, alongside......  your father."
                    The voice intrigued Avery, and she had then stopped crying ever since. The voice is
                    right. She cant cry, it wont accomplish things.... And now she has a goal in mind. <br>

                    The spirit foretold she needs to go deep into the forest to acquire this power, so 
                    she follows the spirit, and she was led deeper into the abbyss. Here in the abbyss,
                    the place looks dark, yet there are sunshine patches coming down from somewhere
                    in the place. And it looks.... beautiful. Avery can't help but stare into the sunlght.
                    She then stood there in the patches of sun, looking up. 
                    The spirit tells her to reach for the light. And she did..... that's when magic happens.
                    She sees her epidermis skin peels off, yet she feels no pain. She can see all her muscles
                    and tendons somehow rearranging, and they make her feel power surging through her veins.
                    Then it reattaches back to the skin, and Avery feels... the great power.

                <h1>Love</h1>
                <p>Avery had started to sneak out more often, her dad always asked her to buy booze
                    and weed. Its what allowed her to roam freely outside. But Avery have another 
                    plan in mind.<br> 
                    Outside of the house, in the city, there was a hanging out spot for children
                    around town. Its a rather quiet and less populated place, so there arent that
                    many people existing in that place. In this place, Avery was known to be the 
                    bully, and the dangerous kid with shady background. Everyone who came across
                    her fears her, she likes to take lunch money from the weaker kids and start a 
                    fight with random people. It doesnt matter who it is. However, there is someone
                    particular from this place that (not too) secretly admires her. Her name is Riley.
                    She is one of the girls who is friends with the "mean girls". Avery doesn't
                    really notice her appearance until after later when Riley starts making a move.
                    She would go out of her way to bring her lunch, give her gifts, and other stuff
                    that Avery have found odd. Since she isn't accustomed to this style of kindness
                    she doesn't really know how to react. One time Avery accidentally stands up for 
                    Riley when her toxic friends were bullying Riley.

                <h1>Beginning</h1>
                <p>She had tried to kill her father plenty of times now. But there is something wrong 
                with her father. No matter how much time she successfully injured him, its like he
                is mutating from the injury. He has start to grow molds and look like a monster. 
                She feels like there is no human left in that flesh of father. Which sort of his own
                upbringing and the faulty of the forests environment (refer to the lore of The Forest).
                However one day, as usual Avery came back home to pick a few stuff up but a fight broke
                between her and her father. That is when he had dropped his alcohol and spilled it
                everywhere on the ground, and Avery had eyed on the lighter for now. She swiftly grabbed
                the lighter and toss it to the ground, causing fire. It started off little, but the more
                the father panics, the more the fire starts to spread. Avery smiles...... she quickly grabs her
                things from her bedroom before it burns and runs off the house with little burns. Her farther
                who is adamant on staying in that shithole burnt to crisp. And thats the end of him.

            </div>

            <div class="text-avery5">
                <h1>Genocide</h1>
                <p>The spirit uses Avery's hatred towards humanity to fulfill the plan which is to 
                    end humanity all at once. It doesnt matter who will fall, they must all die. 
                    Avery had gone through seemingly endless fights to finish her 'mission'.
                    She had gone to the train station to head to her first mission, when in the train
                    she found that Riley was there too. She seems to be carrying a big backpack with her.
                    Normally, she would have gone for her and just end her there, but instead she helped
                    her from the street hooligans trying to violate Riley. 
                    Riley thanks her once again before Avery asks what she's doing with her big backpack.
                    Apparently, just like her they're both running away from home. Forever. 
                    Avery dismissed her rather quickly, but then realized they are heading towards the same
                    location. This motivates Riley to ask Avery to join her in her journey....... since she 
                    has nowhere to go. The two of them head to some spot where Avery wants to test all her
                    trainings of killing people. It's like she has a natural talent, Avery shows great 
                    capabilities of killing literally anyone she wants. But Riley on the other hand, did not
                    sign up for this. She keeps questioning what her reasoning behind her killing is. 
                    Avery simply states that this world is too corrupt, and she will be the end of the corruption.
                    The antihero. Knowing the truth of this, Riley gives her a second chance of trustworthiness. 
                    However, that trust ends when Riley and Avery arrives at the small town where Riley's friends 
                    are. She didn't expect her to go to that length. Yet here she is, killing all of everyone in 
                    the small town like a...... monster. Riley tried to stop her,  but she is far too stronger than
                    her. She couldnt do anything...... so she says to Avery "i am leaving you. no one can help you."
                    Which makes Avery feel....... completely empty. But she disregards her feelings. What's important
                    to her is killing everyone in this world. And even... killing Riley. Yet she couldn't bare to pull
                    the trigger whenever she aims her gun at Riley. Days go by and the dead bodies are piling up.... 
                    news reporter are wary of Avery coming to their locations and killing everybody at sight. All the 
                    hospitals where patients reside, she kills them too. None of them are safe from her wrath and hatred.

                <div class="text-avery6">
                    <h1>Destiny</h1>
                    <p>There is a priest that was tasked by god to stop the wrath of Avery. He is a war veteran
                        who now serves as a priest on a small town. God has foretold what Avery is like... and why
                        she is the way she is. He grows big sympathy for the poor child. That is why he plan on not
                        killing her, but rehabilitating her. Maybe she can be a good person. At least, that's what
                        he positively thinks. Avery came to the small town and reaches the church. The spirit has 
                        told her this would be the finale. If she could kill this priest, then everyone else would be
                        easy to kill, and she would reach godhood. Her final destiny. Preparing the gun and the swords 
                        in her hands, she slashed her way to the priest. But the priest is strong... far stronger than 
                        any of the opponents that she had encountered, but she did not give up. It would all be in vain
                        if she gives up here now. So she continues to pursue the priest. The priest uses kindness and 
                        pacifist route to calm the child down, to make her feel that she is not the bad guy. That she is 
                        just misguided. But Avery is stubborn, she isn't going to be persuaded very easily. The fight 
                        goes for so long, Avery finally concluded not to underestimate this priest. She will have to unleash
                        her true power to defeat him, and the priest know she will do it eventually. He just needs to make
                        sure to exhaust her, then take her in. But rather, something else happened. She could not release
                        her power and end up exhausting herself. The priest wasn't scared of approaching her and welcoming her
                        to his embrace. She was about to give up, she used all her might but she fails..... Avery had fallen 
                        unconscious. The priest thought that his plan have all worked out. He was going to take her in and 
                        take care of her, but something else happened. Something inside of her unlocked. The true power, finally.
                        the sky goes dark and a thunderstorm shatters the world. Finally, the caretaker that had been alongside
                        her all this time shows up. He appears in a grim reaper appearance, approaching the priest that is holding 
                        her. The priest isn't frightened, simply confused. He asked the grim reaper if this was destiny, if This
                        is how its supposed to be. And the grim reaper nods. The world needs to end. And then.... everyones soul 
                        was taken by the grim reaper. Killing everyone except Avery....

                <div class="text-avery7">
                    <h1>End</h1>
                    <p>Avery had woken up in a world rewritten by her. A world where nobody exist, and the world looking 
                        like heaven. Flowers blooming, clear sky, blue ocean and everything without the touch of a human's
                        hand. Avery is... mesmerized. She thought she wouldn't be able to do this, yet here she is. The world
                        finally freed from corruption. But she is alone, in this lonely world. Or so she think she is. She
                        spends more time in the world before taking her life to get it over with. The final deed she wanted
                        to do ever since. But then her spirit calls up to her again, saying there is someone you should see. 
                        She asked who this person is, because she is alone in this world. There is no one else other than her... 
                        and the spirit. But she digress, she still follows the spirit. Avery was led to a garden of sorts.
                        In the garden, there stands a man with a v shirt and a hair covering his eyes, and he sports a hat.
                        The man in question had a very wide and almost eerie and cartoony grin. They look at Avery as if he is
                        expecting her. Avery just prepared her gun and sword, but then she feels her power being seeped out 
                        by the man in question. Without her powers, Avery would just be a normal human with less strength, 
                        so she definitely will lose in a fight. However, the man didnt want to fight Avery. He simply wants to
                        finally answer her biggest question. Which is about her mother, she gasped... how would he know?
                        curious, she asked him for the answer. The man happily obliges as he sent her into unconsciousness. 
                        Into a dream... in the dream, Avery is still an embryo, a fetus.. the mother and father are fighting.
                        They fight because the mother did not ask for a child, and she cannot continue to work as a stripper if
                        shes pregnant, and that would cause her to not get money. The fight was loud and makes Avery's ears pierce
                        , then the dream continues to her mother trying to abort her manually since they couldnt afford abortion
                        bills. It was grotesque, disgusting, and painful. Does she hate her that much? It makes her painful... 
                        Then Avery see the dream changes again to her mother giving birth to her, and how she dies after labor.
                        It was heartwrenching. She coulndt believe that this was all true, her mother hated her and never
                        loved her. She then see the dream changes again to present, Avery is finally herself and she looks 
                        at the mother which is in the same room with her. Mother looked at me disgusted, she hates me, she continues
                        to hit me and call me names, how i wasnt supposed to be born. How im a parasite, and ruined her life, 
                        how i made her look ugly. it all hurts. she just wants it to stop. she wakes up from her unconsciousness
                        and see the man from before gone.<br>
                        after long time of not shedding tears, she finally gave up and broke into tears. So it was true, even
                        her mother hates her. Now she better end herself before everything just gets worse. But then she felt
                        some strong urge to find Riley. Strangely enough, he does find Riley. The grim reaper before had spared
                        his life so he could be with Avery. (Yes Riley is he now because he is not trans)Avery tackle hugs 
                        him and cries to his shoulder. She just asks him to do her a favor to end her already, but Riley 
                        did not oblige. He would never kill Avery. Because he too realizes the truce to what her mission is to
                        the world. So instead of killing her, they both make ammends and reunites again. <br>
                        They both had their fun in the end of the world, but then Riley suggested her to go
                        see what the forest is like now. She kind of grows to dislike that place, but since Riley
                        seems so happy about it, he follows him. They both go to the forest together, and found out
                        that the place had changed entirely... it looks calm and peaceful now, but they havent gone That
                        deep yet. So when they do, thats when it gets dark and scary. Avery wouldnt admit she is scared 
                        of the place, but Riley continues on to see if there are something worth searching for.
                        Little did they know there was a huge creature waiting for them, in the dark. Riley was the first to 
                        spot the creature, suddenly chasing them. They run away from the creature, and hides behind a tree.
                        Thats when Riley sees Avery panicking and acting not like herself, so in order to calm her down, he kissed
                        her. That was her first kiss. Avery is pretty much distracted now, but when they let go- about
                        a second after, Riley sees the creature behind Avery. It mauled her and the only remaining body part
                        is her arm. Riley screamed
